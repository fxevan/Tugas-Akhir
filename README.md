Fault Locator using Wavelet Transform

In this project I'm creating code with Python programming language to locate a transmission line fault location. The method I'm using is Discrete Wavelet transformation.
There are three main part of the code which are :
1. Data import from .csv file into an array
2. Signal transformation using Clarke transformation and Wavelet transformation
3. Wavelet coefficient analysis to determine the fault type and the location of the fault
